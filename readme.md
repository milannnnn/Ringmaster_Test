# Test Report by Milan Milinkovic

To get the test report, please clone the repository to your computer, and run the "Test.ipynb" on a local computer (as it has some interactive graphs that might not render directly on GitHub, especially the pie chart graph displayed in part 4).

Make sure to install all python requirements from the 'requirement.txt' file.

Thank you.

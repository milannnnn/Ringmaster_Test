# Test Report by Milan Milinkovic

To get the test report, please clone the repository to your computer, and run the "Test.ipynb" on a local computer (as it has some interactive graphs in parts 4 and 5 that might not render directly on GitHub).

Make sure to install all python requirements from the 'requirement.txt' file.

Thank you.
